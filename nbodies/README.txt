– Did you manage to complete the assignment?
– If you did not complete the assignment, what is missing? (If your assignment is incomplete or has
known bugs, I prefer that students let me know, rather than let me discover these deficiencies on
my own.)
– How closely does your project meet the requirements specified in the project demos? Have you
taken any artistic liberties?
– Are there additional features, above and beyond the project requirements, that you’ve implemented?
– Are you satisfied with the final result?

#I completed the assignment. I am satisfied with the result.

– What parts of the assignment were particularly challenging?
– What parts of the assignment were easier than you expected?
– What parts of your solution are you particularly proud of?
– Would you have approached the problem differently?

#The challenging parts were converting formulas into stats.
Position part was easier than expected.

Any additional thoughts or questions about the assignment.
– Were the instructions clear?
– Were you given enough support in developing your solution?
– What insight has this project given you into programming, beyond the homework assignments
during the semester?

#The instructions were clear. I received enough support in developing solutions. It is actually
very interesting to solve a more complex problem.
